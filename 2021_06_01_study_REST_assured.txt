Section 2: API Essentials

Ch. 3. What is API?

Application Programmers Interface
- Exposure the functionality of an application.

Ch. 4. What is REST API?

REST = Representational State Transfer.

REST Constraints:
- Client Server
	- Allows the client to speak in their own language and still being able to communicate.
- Stateless
	- Allows the API's to be independent from each other.
	- No state is maintained; i.e. no data is maintained anywhere with regards to the API's after they have finished.
- Cache
	- Allows data storage at the client end for better performance.
- Uniform Interface
- Layered System
- Code on Demand

Ch. 5. What is JSON

JSON = JavaScript Object Notation

- Leightweight
- Humanly readable
- Easy to understand
- Key - Value pairs
- Language agnostic
	- So can be used with every programming language.

--> Preferred communication method between systems / languages.

Ch. 6. REST vs HTTP

HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- Is the protocol used to transfer data over the web.
- Is on top of the network protocol stack.
- Uses the client-server architecture.

REST will use the HTTP protocol.
Technically REST can use any other protocol.
REST is the architectural design.
HTTP is the application protocol.

REST leverages the HTTP protocol in order to transfer data over the internet.
REST uses for this purpose the various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

Ch. 7. API Request Anatomy.

REST API Request:

GET https://api.getpostman.com/workspaces/id
--> URL = Uniform Resource Locator.
	- https://api.getpostman.com
		- Base url (will remain the same for all requests)
	- /workspaces
		- Endpoint
	- /id
		- Path Parameter
	- Specifies:
		- The location in the internet network.
		- A method for retrieving the resource.

For our purposes we will use Postman as client.

- In this case we are retrieving the resource called workspace, identified with the id.

GET = HTTP API method
- Defines how to interact with the resource.


Quiz 1.

- JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
- REST = Architectural Design.
- GET and POST are HTTP methods.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3: Postman Essentials

Ch. 8. Install

- https://www.postman.com/
- https://www.postman.com/downloads/

$ brew install --cask postman

(It was already installed but I want the latest version)

Updating to version 8.5.1.

For additional information:
- Youtube: Postman tutorial 2020
	--> LOT's OF INFORMATION
	- Look at it this evening.

Apparently I'm already logged in with robkremers2014@gmail.com

Start by:
- Create a new workspace
- Create a new request.

Ch. 9. Walkthrough

https://api.postman.com/workspaces

Create environment REST_Assured_Environment
Variable	Initial value
baseUrl		https://api.getpostman.com

Now I can select this environment under 'No Environment'

Use:

GET: {{baseUrl}}/workspaces

The actual value of baseUrl becomes visible when you hover over the parameter with the mouse.

--> Send

Result:

{
    "error": {
        "name": "AuthenticationError",
        "message": "Invalid API Key. Every request requires a valid API Key to be sent."
    }
}

Ch. 10.Generate API Key.

The API Key is connected with our Postman account.

--> Account Settings
--> Postman API Keys
	- Create API Key: 
		- Name		: REST_Assured_Study_key
		- API Key 	: PMAK-60bdc2e9373e5c0035cb614b-e1d5147264bd462b92045f81945dce4a4e
	- The key will only be visible during the created. Later it will be encrypted.


--> Go to the environment
	Variable:
		- api_key
		- Initial Value: PMAK-60be82a8f120f500350530bd-2fff1d21df9f53c9926e75105a22301e67


https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/intro-api/

	You will need to authenticate your requests to the Postman API by sending your API Key in the X-Api-Key header of every request you make.
	Your API Key provides access to any Postman data you have permissions for.
	You can store your API key in an environment variable—if you name it postman-api-key the Postman API collection will use it automatically

	Access to the API using a key is limited to 60 requests per minute.


Ch. 11. API Documentation

View this video again.

Ch. 12. Execute GET Request

--> I keep receiving:

{{baseUrl}}/workspaces?X-Api-Key={{postman-api-key}}

{
    "error": {
    "name": "AuthenticationError",
    "message": "Invalid API Key. Every request requires a valid API Key to be sent."
}

--> Continue here tomorrow.

https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/intro-api/

Authentication
You will need to authenticate your requests to the Postman API by sending your API Key in the X-Api-Key header of every request you make.

Your API Key provides access to any Postman data you have permissions for.

I have created:
- Postman Essentails Workspace
	- Postman Essentials Collection
		getPostmanWorkspaces
	- Postman Essentials Environment
		- baseUrl
		- apiKey

https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/GettingStarted

JsonPath

Standalone JsonPath (included if you depend on the rest-assured artifact). Makes it easy to parse JSON documents. Note that this JsonPath implementation uses Groovy's GPath syntax and is not to be confused with Kalle Stenflo's JsonPath implementation.

Maven:

<dependency>
      <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
      <artifactId>json-path</artifactId>
      <version>4.4.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

XmlPath

Stand-alone XmlPath (included if you depend on the rest-assured artifact). Makes it easy to parse XML documents.

Maven:

<dependency>
      <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
      <artifactId>xml-path</artifactId>
      <version>4.4.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>


JSON Schema Validation

If you want to validate that a JSON response conforms to a Json Schema you can use the json-schema-validator module:

Maven:

<dependency>
      <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
      <artifactId>json-schema-validator</artifactId>
      <version>4.4.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

Spring Mock Mvc

If you're using Spring Mvc you can now unit test your controllers using the RestAssuredMockMvc API in the spring-mock-mvc module. For this to work you need to depend on the spring-mock-mvc module:

Maven:

<dependency>
      <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-mock-mvc</artifactId>
      <version>4.4.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>


Spring Web Test Client

If you're using Spring Webflux you can now unit test your reactive controllers using the RestAssuredWebTestClient API in the spring-mock-mvc module. For this to work you need to depend on the spring-web-test-client module:

Maven:

<dependency>
      <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-web-test-client</artifactId>
      <version>4.4.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

- http://groovy-lang.org/processing-xml.html#_gpath


Parsing a JSON string means:
- recursively convert into a list of map of objects.

- https://groovy-lang.org/json.html
	- https://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/core-semantics.html#gpath_expressions

http://groovy-playground.appspot.com/
--> Used for testing a json object. For an example see below.

import groovy.json.JsonSlurper

def object = new JsonSlurper().parseText(
    '''
 {
  "firstName": "Larry",
  "lastName": "Sheen",
  "age": 30,
  "children": [],
  "spouse": null,
  "vehicle": true,
  "address": {
    "street": "6301 Richardson Drive",
    "city": "New York City",
    "state": "New York",
    "zipCode": "65027"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "mobile",
      "number": "543 666-6794"
    },
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "555 650-2200"
    }
  ]
}   
    '''
)

def query = object.address.street
def query = object.phoneNumbers[0]
def query = object.phoneNumbers.number # Now the bracket is returned: both phonenumbers will be displayed.


Ch. 15. Fetch JSON using JayWay's JsonPath

Resources:
- https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath
	- Jayway JsonPath A Java DSL for reading JSON documents.
- https://jsonpath.com/


Ch. 16. Groovy's GPath Vs. JayWay's JsonPath

https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/GettingStarted#jsonpath

JsonPath implementation uses Groovy's GPath syntax and is not to be confused with Kalle Stenflo's JsonPath implementation.

Maven:

<dependency>
      <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
      <artifactId>json-path</artifactId>
      <version>4.4.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

Find all phone numbers in the example:
- Groovy:
	def query = object.phoneNumbers.number
- JsonPath:
	$.phoneNumbers..number


Quiz 2. 
Question 1:
JSON key can be a String or an Integer
- False
Question 2:
JSON cannot have two keys with same name
- True
Question 3:
REST Assured includes JsonPath implementation that uses
- Groovy's GPATH syntax.
Question 4:
JsonSlurper is a
- Class

Question 5:
From below JSON, query to fetch "my address" as a String is
import groovy.json.JsonSlurper

def object = new JsonSlurper().parseText(
    '''
{
	"address": [
		[
			{
				"address": {
					"address": "my address"
				}
			}
		]
	]
} 
    '''
)

def query = object.address[0][0].address.address
# There is an array within the array!!!

Groovy's GPATH expression and JayWay's expression always result in the same query
- Although both use dot notations, queries can be different

Section 5: HTTP Essentials

Ch. 17. HTTP Concepts: Safe, Idempotent and Cacheable.

Resources:
- https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml
	- 39 methods are available.
- https://medium.com/maverick-labs/a-quick-overview-of-http-methods-51098b1300bd


The more often used methods: See also Overview_HTTP_methods.xlsx
METHOD 		Description 																		                                     Request body Response body Safe Idempotent Cacheable
GET       Transfer a current representation of the target resource 								               No 			    Yes 		    Yes 	 Yes 	       Yes
HEAD      Same as GET, but only transfer the status line and header sections 						         No  		       No 			   Yes 	 Yes 	       Yes
POST 		  Perform resource-specific processing on the request payload 							            Yes 		      Yes 		    No 		 No 		   In some cases
PUT 		  Replace all current representations of the target payload with the request payload 		Yes 		       No 			    No 		Yes 	      No
DELETE 		Remove all current representations of the target resource 								           Optional 	    Optional 	    No 		Yes 	      No
CONNECT 	Establish a tunnel to the service identified by the target resource 					        No  		      Yes 		    No 		 No 		       No
OPTIONS 	Describe the communication options for the target resource 								            No 			      Yes 		    Yes 	 Yes 	         No
TRACE 		Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource 					      No 			      No 			    Yes 	 Yes 	         No
PATCH 		Perform partial modification of the target resource. 									                Yes 		      Yes 		    No 		 No 		     No

Safe 		    : means that no data on the server will be updated.
Itempotent  : The use of the method will not affect the outcome of the response.
Cacheable 	: This means that the server can cache the response. This will affect the performance.


Ch. 18. GET

Example:
- Postman:
  - GET {{baseUrl}}/workspaces/

{
    "workspaces": [
        {
            "id": "5a7edc8d-9407-4010-8935-31e851c39449",
            "name": "My Workspace",
            "type": "personal"
        },
        {
            "id": "7fcf506e-2dfa-4530-ba94-78a0a315a86b",
            "name": "Postman Essentials Workspace",
            "type": "team"
        },
        {
            "id": "efbb8b92-6110-4e3a-8c6e-81e8b511fe9d",
            "name": "Team Workspace",
            "type": "team"
        }
    ]
}

  - GET {{baseUrl}}/workspaces/7fcf506e-2dfa-4530-ba94-78a0a315a86b # the ID of Postman Essentials Workspace
{
    "workspace": {
        "id": "7fcf506e-2dfa-4530-ba94-78a0a315a86b",
        "name": "Postman Essentials Workspace",
        "type": "team",
        "description": null,
        "collections": [
            {
                "id": "d51ca0ce-b167-4df8-8228-60ddc003e009",
                "name": "Postman Essentials Collection",
                "uid": "2814220-d51ca0ce-b167-4df8-8228-60ddc003e009"
            }
        ],
        "environments": [
            {
                "id": "45abc7d9-27f8-41e5-aff1-17cd232e6093",
                "name": "Postman Essentials Environment",
                "uid": "2814220-45abc7d9-27f8-41e5-aff1-17cd232e6093"
            }
        ]
    }
}

--> Now you also have the collections of requests and the environments.

In the case of GET no response body, because this is not required.


Ch. 19. HEAD

HEAD

Same as GET, but only transfer the status line and header sections 

HEAD requests are used to retrieve just the headers that would be present in the response of an equivalent GET call. 
It could be used simply to check whether or not a resource exists, or to retrieve the Content-Length Header before deciding whether or not to download a large file. 
You could also check the Last-Modified header to see if the file was modified since you last retrieved it. 
The HEAD method is safe. 
All safe methods are also idempotent since doing nothing once has the same effect as doing nothing multiple times.

- No request body
- No response body.

Useful e.g. if you want to check in advance how large the response body of a GET will be.

Only returned are:
- HTTP status (200 OK)
- Header content

Ch. 20. POST

Perform resource-specific processing on the request payload 

POST

POST requests are used to submit data to the server. 
POST requests may contain a data payload to be submitted to the server. 
The action performed by the server is determined by the server code. 
POST requests may be used to create a new resource or to submit data for processing.


POST {{baseUrl}}/workspaces/
- Additional header:
  - X-Api-Key: {{apiKey}}

# The "id" should not be added, because Postman will create a new value. But adding an "id" at this POST will for Postman not cause an error.
{
    "workspace": {
        "id": "7fcf506e-2dfa-4530-ba94-78a0a315a86b",
        "name": "Another Workspace",
        "type": "personal",
        "description": "workspace for testing the POST HTTP method"
    }
}

Response:
{
    "workspace": {
        "id": "454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e",
        "name": "Another Workspace"
    }
}

--> Now: GET {{baseUrl}}/workspaces/
  --> The new workspace will be visible now.
--> GET {{baseUrl}}/workspaces/454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e

Response:
{
    "workspace": {
        "id": "454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e",
        "name": "Another Workspace",
        "type": "personal",
        "description": "workspace for testing the POST HTTP method"
    }
}

--> For Postman a response for a specific workspace will return more information if there is any (but again: this is a Postman API feature).

Ch. 21. PUT

PUT   Replace all current representations of the target payload with the request payload.

PUT

PUT requests are used to save an object at the location specified in the request URI. 
PUT requests should be idempotent. 
  That means that if two or more identical PUT requests are received and executed, the result should be equivalent to executing such a request only once. 
  To draw an analogy, a=5 is an idempotent operation since running it once or multiple times results in the value of a being 5. In contrast, a=a+1 is not an idempotent operation, since the value of a changes based on how many times we execute the operation.

A PUT request is not safe because it overwrites data.

PUT {{baseUrl}}/workspaces/454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e

Body:
curl --location \
--request PUT 'https://api.getpostman.com/workspaces/454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: PMAK-60be82a8f120f500350530bd-5564f633c07f09b9472b464b32bbb43cc3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "workspace": {
        "id": "454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e",
        "name": "Another Workspace2",
        "type": "personal",
        "description": "workspace for testing the POST HTTP method"
    }
}'

Response:
{
    "workspace": {
        "id": "454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e",
        "name": "Another Workspace2"
    }
}
--> The existing workspace with id = "454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e" has received a new name: "Another Workspace" -> "Another Workspace2"

It's idempotent because repeats of the POST will give the same result.

Ch. 22. DELETE

DELETE  Remove all current representations of the target resource 

DELETE requests are used to delete the object at the location specified in the request URI. DELETE requests are also idempotent.

The Request and Response body are optional.
So in our case the id would be enough to delete the workspace with that id.

The DELETE method can not be cached because the content will be deleted.

curl --location \
--request DELETE 'https://api.getpostman.com/workspaces/454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: PMAK-60be82a8f120f500350530bd-5564f633c07f09b9472b464b32bbb43cc3'

Response:

{
    "workspace": {
        "id": "454d8e61-a754-490b-8534-18c4c6f5860e"
    }
}

If trying to execute a 2nd time:

{
    "error": {
        "name": "instanceNotFoundError",
        "message": "The specified workspace does not exist."
    }
}

HTTP status: 404 Not Found.


Ch. 23. OPTIONS

OPTIONS Describe the communication options for the target resource 

Usually it is used as pre-flight request and using the response to make the real request.
- e.g. knowing which headers are request.

This is a readonly, non-cacheable request.

curl --location \
--request OPTIONS 'https://api.getpostman.com/workspaces/' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: PMAK-60be82a8f120f500350530bd-5564f633c07f09b9472b464b32bbb43cc3'

--> In this case there is no response body.
--> Look at the Headers:
  - Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE
  - Access-Control-Allow-Headers: content-type,x-api-key

  --> So we know that we have to make known the content-type and fill in x-api-key

  Ch. 24. PATCH

  PATCH   Perform partial modification of the target resource. 


  https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/folder/12959542-082c1f3c-34c2-4525-8880-5411eecd575b?ctx=documentation
  --> You can see that no PATCH HTTP method has been defined.

  For testing this use e.g. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
  --> Setup by the course author.


  CH. 25. Status Codes

  Resources:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

  All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes or categories.
  The first digit of the status code defines the class of response, while the last two digits do not have any classifying or categorization role. 
  There are five classes defined by the standard:

  - 1xx informational response – the request was received, continuing process
  - 2xx successful – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
  - 3xx redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
  - 4xx client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
  - 5xx server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request

Ch. 26. Status Codes - Live Examples

Using https://reqres.in/ for examples

Quiz 3

- DELETE is idempotent
  - True
- GET method can be used to create a new resource
  - Yes
    Yes, this is true, but this is not at all recommended. 
    REST is an architectural design and it specifies certain guidelines. 
    Whether to follow or not, is up to the development team. 
    Most of the times, teams strictly follow what is recommended, but some times there can be poorly designed REST APIs.
- Caching helps increase API performance
  - True
- OPTIONS is cacheable
  - False
- Why is PUT idempotent
  -
- 4xx status codes represent server side issues
  - False

Section 6: Postman Mock Server

Ch. 27. Setup Mock Server with Multiple Examples.

Purpose:
- Mock the server API's of a project.

Resources:
- https://www.postman.com/features/mock-api/
  --> Read the Docs
  https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/

- Create a collection 'Mock Collection' (does not yet contain REST requests)
- Create a mock server 'Mock Server' with the 'Mock Collection' and 'Postman Essentials Environment'.
- Version: 'CURRENT'.
- Don't make the mock server private (for now).
- Check: Create the Mock Server as an environment variable.
- The Mock URL: https://0cfbbd01-fbce-453b-91c1-41c2b17b356d.mock.pstmn.io

--> Now there is an environment: 
  - Name: Mock Server
    - url: https://0cfbbd01-fbce-453b-91c1-41c2b17b356d.mock.pstmn.io

If the Environmenet 'Mock Server' is chosen the url can be used, bein an environment variable.

Create a GET:
- GET {{url}}/get
  - Save in the collection 'Mock Server'.

- Execute 'GET'

Result:

{
    "error": {
        "name": "mockRequestNotFoundError",
        "message": "To mock this request add an example response for the mock server to return.",
        "header": "You need an example"
    }
}

--> A mock example needs to be set up.
  --> Click at rightmost '...'.

Create the Mock response:
- Name: 200 (== Succesful)
- url : {{url}}/get
- body:
{
    "message": "successful"
}

Save.

Now execute the GET request again:
- GET {{url}}/get

Response:
{
    "message": "successful"
}

Try it in a browser (FireFox):
https://0cfbbd01-fbce-453b-91c1-41c2b17b356d.mock.pstmn.io/get

Response:
{
    "message": "successful"
}

Raw data:
{
    "message": "successful"
}

Headers:
X-Firefox-Spdy: h2
access-control-allow-origin: *
content-encoding: gzip
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
date: Sat, 12 Jun 2021 21:51:06 GMT
etag: W/"a4-7hO0T/XLq3TuFViTu2ZVQQdIY+A"
server: nginx
vary: Accept-Encoding
x-ratelimit-limit: 120
x-ratelimit-remaining: 119
x-ratelimit-reset: 1623534071
x-srv-span: v=1;s=4568d6a27d9ad20b
x-srv-trace: v=1;t=14e12dab109713f2

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Connection: keep-alive
Host: 0cfbbd01-fbce-453b-91c1-41c2b17b356d.mock.pstmn.io
If-None-Match: W/"a4-7hO0T/XLq3TuFViTu2ZVQQdIY+A"
TE: Trailers
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0

--> So the server is not local but resides at Postman.


Now another example: HTTP 503
- Create example
  Create the Mock response:
  - Name: 503 (== service unavailable)
  - url : {{url}}/get
  - body:
  {
      "message": "service unavailable"
  }

Execute the request again:
GET {{url}}/get

Response:
{
    "message": "service unavailable"
}
HTTP status: 503 Service Unavailable.

--> Two mock responses against the same request will not work.

Adapt the two mock responses:

Mock response 200:
GET {{url}}/200

Mock response 503:
GET {{url}}/503

Execute as follows:
GET {{url}}/get/200
Reponse:
{
    "message": "successful"
}
HTTP status: 200

GET {{url}}/get/503
{
    "message": "service unavailable"
}
HTTP status: 503

If we do not want to change the GET request every time we can use a header parameter to add the GET input parameter:

Headers:
- x-mock-response-code: 200

Execute as follows:
GET {{url}}/get
Reponse:
{
    "message": "successful"
}
HTTP status: 200

Now change the mock responses too:

Mock Response : 
- Mock Collection / getMock / 200
  - GET {{url}}/get
  - Response Body:

{
    "message": "successful"
}

HTTP Status Code: 200

Idem Mock Collection / getMock / 503

--> Execute:

GET {{url}}/get
Headers:
- x-mock-response-code: 200

--> Expected response.
Idem of x-mock-response-code: 503

So for a given situation: 
- Create a Mock example in order to define a correct response.
- These examples can later be used in order to execute REST Assured tests.


Ch. 28. Use Mock Server to Practice All HTTP Status Codes

I have implemented:
- HTTP status
  200
  400
  403
  404
  500
  501
  503

Quiz 4.

Mock Server can be used to:
- Automate UI tests even when the backend is not available.
- Automate API tests even when the API's are not implemented.
- Both --> Correct.

Ch. 39. OOP - Abstraction using abstract class

Abstraction: Hide details and show only essential information!

Abstract class
--------------
Provides partial abstraction
Abstract method is declared without implementation
Abstract class cannot be directly instantiated
Sub class can access Abstract class using extends keyword
Sub class must implement all abstract methods i.e. Overriding is compulsory
Abstract class can have parameterized constructor

Adv
---
Reduces complexity by hiding implementation
Better viewing
Avoids code duplication and promotes reusability
Increases security by providing only important details to the user

E.g.
----
Shapes: Abstract
Triangle: SubClass1
Square: SubClass2

Ch. 42. File Operations

Section 8: Rest Assured - Setup

Ch. 43. What is Rest Assured.

Resources:
- https://rest-assured.io/


Ch. 44. Setup Pre-Requisites

Necessary:
- Java JDK-8
- TestNG
- IDE - IntelliJ
- Maven

Ch. 45. Setup Java JDK.

Ch. 46. Create project using IntelliJ.

Resources:
- https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/GettingStarted#contents
- https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#static-imports
- https://www.javadoc.io/static/org.testng/testng/6.9.4/index.html
- https://javadoc.io/static/io.rest-assured/rest-assured/4.4.0/index.html?overview-summary.html

Project:
- $HOME/Development/workspaceStudy/RestAssured

Modernize the properties:

    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>
        <java.version>1.8</java.version>
    </properties>

Add to pom.xml:
- rest-assured
  - version 4.4.0.
    - This version already contains json-path: 4.4.0.
- testng
  - version 7.4.0.


        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
            <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
            <version>4.4.0</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
            <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
            <version>7.4.0</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>


Static imports

In order to use REST assured effectively it's recommended to statically import methods from the following classes:

io.restassured.RestAssured.*
io.restassured.matcher.RestAssuredMatchers.*
org.hamcrest.Matchers.*

So:

import org.testng.annotations.Test;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;
import static io.restassured.matcher.RestAssuredMatchers.*;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;

public class TestClass {

    @Test
    public void test() {
        given()
                .when()
                .then();
    }
}

It is possible (but not in my case) that an exception occurs:
- please use the JVM argument [-Dtestng.dtd.http=true]

Edit configurations
- Templates
  - TestNG
    - VM Options:
      - Add: -Dtestng.dtd.http=true

This poses no problem for me but I have added it nonetheless. Keeps going okay.
Removing it again....


Quiz 5:
Question 1:
Can I use REST Assured with .NET?
- No
  - But a port to .NET exists.
Question 2:

Ch. 55. Automate GET Request - Assert Response body..

- http://groovy-playground.appspot.com/
  - Site for testing json files groovy-style.

--> Use the Groovy-playground to determine the path, that is necessary for determining the name of a specific workspace.
- Spend some time on Groovy.
  Especially:

import groovy.json.JsonSlurper

def object = new JsonSlurper().parseText(
    '''
{
    "workspaces": [
        {
            "id": "1b7a0f2c-f29e-47a5-9876-8209a17feb34",

  - See below.

  -> Hamcrest is a well known assertion library used for unit testing along with JUnit.
  -> Hamcrest can be used along with Rest Assured for assertions.
  -> Uses matcher classes for making assertions

  Adv:
  -> Human readable and in plain english
  -> Code is neat and intuitive
  -> Provides thin methods like "is" and "not", also called as decorators, for more readibility

  Hamcrest Vs TestNG
  -> Readibility
  -> Descriptive error messages
  -> Type Safety

Hamcrest:

  java.lang.AssertionError: 
  Expected: "Postman Essentials Workspace1"
       but: was "Postman Essentials Workspace"
  Expected :Postman Essentials Workspace1
  Actual   :Postman Essentials Workspace
  <Click to see difference>

  Collection matchers (List, Array, Map, etc.)
  ==============================================
  hasItem() -> check single element in a collection
  not(hasItem()) -> check single element is NOT in a collection
  hasItems() -> Check all elements are in a collection
  contains() -> Check all elements are in a collection and in a strict order
  containsInAnyOrder() -> Check all elements are in a collection and in any order
  empty() -> Check if collection is empty
  not(emptyArray()) -> Check if the Array is not empty
  hasSize() -> Check size of a collection
  everyItem(startsWith()) -> Check if every item in a collection starts with specified string

  hasKey() -> Map -> Check if Map has the specified key [value is not checked]
  hasValue() -> Map -> Check if Map has at least one key matching specified value
  hasEntry() -> Maps -> Check if Map has the specified key value pair
  equalTo(Collections.EMPTY_MAP) -> Maps [Check if empty]
  allOf() -> Matches if all matchers matches
  anyOf() -> Matches if any of the matchers matches

  Numbers:
  greaterThanOrEqualTo()
  lessThan()
  lessThanOrEqualTo()

  String:
  containsString()
  emptyString()


Ch. 60 Hamcrest Collection Matches - Part 1.

Test Hamcrest methods.

  contains() -> Check all elements are in a collection and in a strict order
  containsInAnyOrder() -> Check all elements are in a collection and in any order

Ch. 63. Hamcrest Collection Matches - Part 4.

Quiz 6.

Question 1:
- Why REST Assured use static imports even though it's not normally recommended in Java?
  - Code readability
  - Reduced code
Question 2:
- Are Hamcrest assertions type safe?
  - Yes
Question 3:
Given below JSON Array, and assertion, is it a success?

body("address", contains(1, 2))
{
  "address": [
        1, 2, 3
  ]
}

  - No -> contains will check whether the expected and actual content are equal.

Question 4:
Given below JSON Object, and assertion, will this work?

body("address", empty())

{
  "address": ""
}

- No: empty() Creates a matcher for Collections matching examined collections whose isEmpty method returns true.
  - The json above mentioned does not contain a collection.

Question 5:
- allOff() and anyOff() can be used on Collections
  - No: allOff() and anyOff() can only be used on Strings

Section 12: Rest Assured - Handling Headers

Ch. 67. What are Headers?

- Request headers
- Response headers

Resources:
- https://iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml
  - Overview of all possible headers.

User-Agent:
  - e.g.:
    - PostmanRuntime/7.28.0
    - Chrome
    - Firefox
    - etc.

- Postman:
  - Standard headers
  - Custom headers
    - Custom headers are the headers set by the developer of the API. 
      The API specs or the developer can provide the information.


The response contains (in our case) 15 headers.

Ch. 68. Set Mock Environment for Headers.

We can assert the response headers.

Copy url Postman mockserver: https://0cfbbd01-fbce-453b-91c1-41c2b17b356d.mock.pstmn.io
(the mockserver has already been created)

            }
        ]
    }
}

Create a new request:

See collection 'Mock Collection' with environment 'Mock Server Environment'
- 'Mock Server Environment' contains the intended url (https://0cfbbd01-fbce-453b-91c1-41c2b17b356d.mock.pstmn.io)

x-mock-match-request-headers

        "message": "Double check your method and the request path and try again.",
        "header": "No matching requests"
    }
}

For the situation that header values need to be checked using a mock server the following needs to be done:
- Create a Mock GET request
  - GET {{url}}/get
    - Request:
      - Headers:
        - header: value1  # THIS REALLY HAS TO HAVE THE NAME 'header'. Anything else will cause the error mentioned above.
        - x-mock-match-request-headers: header  # Indicator for Postman which custom header parameter to use as identifier of the Mock response.
    - Response:
      ! This is the response created below because haeder: value1 matches with the corresponding example.
      - Headers:
        - responseHeader: responseValue2  # This is a custom value and points to the corresponding example.
      - Body:
        {
            "message": "responseValue1"
        }
      - Status: 200

  - Create Examples, in which the several situations need to be defined.
    - Request:
      - Headers
        - header: value1
    - Response:
      - Headers:
        - responseHeader: responseValue1 # Custom
        - Content-Type: application/json
      - Status Code: 200
    - Body:
      {
          "message": "responseValue1"
      }

header1 = value1

header2 = value2

Can I send the headers like this?

headers("header1", "value1", "header2", "value2")

Yes

Question 2:
I'm sending below header info in the request. Which of the below statements is true.

header("header1", "value1", "header2", "value2")

It will send three headers with same header

Ch. 78. BDD to non-BDD.

Ch. 79. Request Specification Builder.

Ch. 80. Default Request Specification.

Ch. 81. Query Request Specification.

Quiz 9. 


Question 1:
What is Request and Response specification in REST Assured?
- Interface

Question 2:
Is it possible to have multiple default request specifications?
- No: it is a static parameter of Class RestAssured. In that case only one specification is possible.

Question 3:
Is it possible to create multiple request and response specifications?
- Yes
  - It is possible to create multiple instances of requestSpecBuilder.
    Therefore it is possible to let RestAssured.requestSpecification point to different RequestSpecBuilder instances
    depending on the situation.

Question 4:
I have below request specification:

RequestSpecification requestSpecification = with().
                baseUri("https://api.postman.com").
                header("X-Api-Key", "PMAK-5ff2d720d2a39a004250e5da-c658c4a8a1cee3516762cb1a51cba6c5e2").
                log().all();
and I have below given statement:

given(requestSpecification).
        baseUri("https://8f6d7436-aba9-4c1f-bc81-fdc881a11fb1.mock.pstmn.io").
        header("header1", "value1").

Which out of below statements is true?
- baseUri in the request specification is overwritten by the baseUri in the given statement
  while the header in the request specification gets appended to the header in the given statement.

Question 5:
I have below request specification:

RequestSpecification requestSpecification = with().
                baseUri("https://api.postman.com").
                header("X-Api-Key", "PMAK-5ff2d720d2a39a004250e5da-c658c4a8a1cee3516762cb1a51cba6c5e2").
                log().all();
and I have below statements in my test case:

        given().
        when().
                get("/get").
        then().
                log().all().
                assertThat().
                statusCode(200);

Will the test case execute successfully?
- No.
  - Reason:
    I am not using the RestAssured.requestSpecification but a separate value.
    In that case I need to give the RestAssured.requestSpecification to the given() method as input: given(requestSpecification).

Quiz 11.

Question 1:
I have below response specification:

ResponseSpecification responseSpecification = RestAssured.expect().
                statusCode(200).
                contentType(ContentType.JSON).
This is my test case:

given().
        body(file).
when().
        post("/workspaces").
then().spec(responseSpecification).
        log().all();
The API returns no response body and HTTP status code is 200.

Will this succeed ?

Yes in my case, but the official answer is 'No'.

Question 2:
In my test case, I'm using path parameter like this. Will it work?

String workspaceId = "cd8832a4-0778-4683-a2ee-97a3f17d2ee7";
String payload = "{\n" +
        "    \"workspace\": {\n" +

Assignment 1. Assignment - Automate Complex JSON.

Here's another good complex JSON example that you can automate sending using REST Assured.

As shown in the lectures, create a POST Mock request and execute it through Postman. Use this JSON as the request payload.

Then use REST Assured to automate this mock request.

Use Map and List to represent this complex JSON just like how I have shown in the lecture.

The only requirement for this exercise is, do not watch the lecture again if you face any issue. 
Do self debugging and searching on the internet. 
So to make sure you understood the concept, feel free to watch the lectures multiple times, but before starting with this exercise.

Questions for this assignment
Explain the process that facilitates conversion of Java objects (Map, List, etc.) to JSON


- Created Mock POST request {{baseUrl}}/postComplexJsonAssignment1
  - Added an example
  - The Mock request works.

- $HOME/Development/workspaceStudy/RestAssured/src/test/java/com/rest/Part11TestPostPayloadComplexJsonAssignment.java

Setup: 
- In pom.xml of the project has been added:

<!--- Jackson-databind is necessary in case an object is sent as body as value of a Map -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.12.4</version>
</dependency>

The core of the functionality is class io.restassured RestAssured
- In pom.xml of the project has been added:
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
    <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
    <version>4.4.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

(And a number of other relevant dependencies to support the processing)

- The test class:

The core of the test class is based on class RestAssured.
- First in a method with annotation @BeforeClass is assigned value to:
  - baseURI
  - basePath
  - requestSpecification = requestSpecBuilder.build();
  - responseSpecification = responseSpecBuilder.build();

These parameters will be used by the following RestAssured methods.
This means that no parameters will need to be added to these methods.

Now the complex JSON that will be sent to the Postman Mockserver will be set up using Map and List.

The complete body of the test class is given below. I have left out the values of RestAssured.baseURI.

@Slf4j
public class Part11TestPostPayloadComplexJsonAssignment {

    /**
     * Local parameters
     */
    private final int HTTP_Status_code_OK = 200;
    private final int HTTP_Status_code_Created = 201;

    Response response;

    @BeforeClass
    public void init() {
        // The base Url of the Mock server that has been set up in Postman.
        baseURI = "<Postman Mockserver Uri";
        basePath = "/postComplexJsonAssignment1";

        RequestSpecBuilder requestSpecBuilder = new RequestSpecBuilder();
        requestSpecBuilder
                .setBaseUri(baseURI)
                .addHeader("x-mock-match-request-body", "true")
                .setContentType("application/json; charset=utf-8")
                .log(LogDetail.ALL);
        requestSpecification = requestSpecBuilder.build();

        // Note that this will not show the logging. '.log(LogDetail.ALL)' Doesn't work.
        ResponseSpecBuilder responseSpecBuilder = new ResponseSpecBuilder()
                .expectStatusCode(HTTP_Status_code_OK)
                .expectContentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .log(LogDetail.ALL);

        responseSpecification = responseSpecBuilder.build();
    }

    /**

Quiz 13: Quiz

Question 1:
Query parameters are separated by:
- '&'

Question 2:
I have two query parameters as below:

foo1 = bar1

foo2 = bar2

Is it possible to send these query parameters like below?

queryParams("foo1", "bar1", "foo2", "bar2")

Answer:
- No
  - Possible methods:
    - RequestSpecification queryParams(String var1, Object var2, Object... var3);
    - RequestSpecification queryParams(Map<String, ?> var1);

- ????
  Apparently the answer is: yes.
  - .queryParams("foo1", "bar1", "foo2", "bar2")
  - Results in:
    Query params: foo1=bar1
                  foo2=bar2
    "args": {
        "foo1": "bar1",
        "foo2": "bar2"
    }

Question 3:
In case of multi value query parameter, which of the below is allowed?
- .queryParam("foo1", "bar1;bar2;bar3")
- .queryParam("foo1", "bar1,bar2,bar3")
- both
  - This is the correct answer.

Section 19: Rest Assured - Multipart Form Data

Ch. 101. What is Multipart Form Data?

Looking at: 
- POST http://postman-echo.com/post?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2
  - It is possible to fill in form-data instead of raw / JSON.
  - From-data:
    - key - value 
    - Is also called multipart form data.
      - This means that the data is sent in parts to the server.
        So the file / content is not sent in one go, but in parts.

- Resources:
  - https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#multi-part-from-data

given().
        multiPart(new File("/path/to/file")).
when().
        post("/upload");


The control name in this case is the name of the input tag with name "file". 
If you have a different control name then you need to specify it:

given().
        multiPart("controlName", new File("/path/to/file")).
when().
        post("/upload");

It's also possible to supply multiple "multi-parts" entities in the same request:
(so using multiple key-value pairs)

byte[] someData = ..
given().
        multiPart("controlName1", new File("/path/to/file")).
        multiPart("controlName2", "my_file_name.txt", someData).
        multiPart("controlName3", someJavaObject, "application/json").
when().
        post("/upload");

For more advanced use cases you can make use of the MultiPartSpecBuilder. For example:

Greeting greeting = new Greeting();
greeting.setFirstName("John");
greeting.setLastName("Doe");

given().
        multiPart(new MultiPartSpecBuilder(greeting, ObjectMapperType.JACKSON_2)
                .fileName("greeting.json")
                .controlName("text")
                .mimeType("application/vnd.custom+json").build()).
when().
        post("/multipart/json").
then().
        statusCode(200);


As an example:
- See in Postman: POST postman-get.com/post
  - Body:
    - form-data
      - form-data-key1: form-data-value1

- Response:
  - See: "form"
{
    "args": {
        "foo1": "bar1",
        "foo2": "bar2"
    },
    "data": {},
    "files": {},
    "form": {
        "form-data-key1": "form-data-value1"
    },
    "headers": {
        "x-forwarded-proto": "http",
        "x-forwarded-port": "80",
        "host": "postman-echo.com",
        "x-amzn-trace-id": "Root=1-6106edd8-2495f2952327b7cc0e05cae0",

        "content-type": "multipart/form-data; boundary=--------------------------761507422595210622726132",
        "user-agent": "PostmanRuntime/7.28.2",
        "accept": "*/*",
        "cache-control": "no-cache",
        "postman-token": "f34c73ba-08c4-4853-b172-5054e5e902dd",

    },
    "json": null,
    "url": "http://postman-echo.com/post?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2"
}

    RequestSpecification multiPart(String var1, String var2);

    RequestSpecification multiPart(String var1, String var2, String var3);

}


Question 3:
Is it possible to supply multiple "multi-parts" entities in the same request?
- Yes
  - Based on the declarations above and based on the experiment below.

    "form": {
        "form-data-key1": "form-data-value1,form-data-value2"
    },

Question 4:
If we are using multipart() method to send the Multipart form data, is it required to explicitly set the content type of the request to multipart/form-data?
- No.

Section 19: Rest Assured - File Upload and Download.

Ch. 103. Upload File.

In Postman:
- POST
  - Body
    - form-data
      - key: 
        - file (just a name) with indicator 'file'.
      - value:
        - Now a button 'Select Files' is visible.
          - When this button is clicked a file can be choosen via a pop-directory.
      - key:
        - attributes
      - value:
        - {"name":"multipart-test.txt","parent":{"id":"123456"}}
          - parent is the directory to which we need to upload the file.

Ch. 104. Download file.

https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/sample-code/apps/ApiDemos-debug.apk
- download a file (click on button Download)

- F12: Developer tool
  - Tab Network
    - Refresh
    - Headers
      - file apiDemos-debug.apk
        -
          Request URL: https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/sample-code/apps/ApiDemos-debug.apk
          Request Method: GET
          Status Code: 200 # can also be 304
          Remote Address: 140.82.121.3:443
          Referrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

The above mentioned URL is not correct.
Use the following:
        baseURI = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com";
        basePath = "/appium/appium/master/sample-code/apps/ApiDemos-debug.apk";

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
HTTP 304:
Not Modified (RFC 7232)
    Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. In such case, there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.[25]


Quiz 15. Quiz.

Question 1:
Using REST Assured, is it possible to send multiple "multi-parts" entities of different content types?
- Yes.

Question 2:
In case of Multipart form data, the default content type used by REST Assured for the text data is
- text/plain

Question 3:
REST Assured supports extracting response as Byte array as well as Input stream
- True.

Section 21: Rest Assured - Form URL Encoding.

Ch. 105. What is Form URL Encoding?


Resources:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST


- application/x-www-form-urlencoded: the keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by '&', with a '=' between the key and the value. 
  Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values are percent encoded: this is the reason why this type is not suitable to use with binary data (use multipart/form-data instead)
- multipart/form-data: each value is sent as a block of data ("body part"), with a user agent-defined delimiter ("boundary") separating each part. 
  The keys are given in the Content-Disposition header of each part.
- text/plain

Example of x-www-form-urlencoded:
key1=value1&key2=value2
--> 
key 1=value 1 # The space will be replaced by %20 == the ANSII code for a space ' '.
-->
key%201=value%201

curl --location --request POST 'http://postman-echo.com/post?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2&foo3=space example' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: PMAK-60be82a8f120f500350530bd-5564f633c07f09b9472b464b32bbb43cc3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Cookie: sails.sid=s%3AGOuQ7e_eEIgneDSO86FejzpBMCuzsDcQ.3COcw1ynK1%2BB%2BCBA1ZRRdMHV730MrTfa5PjoKZNHolo' \
--data-urlencode 'key1=value1'

Response:
{
    "args": {
        "foo1": "bar1",
        "foo2": "bar2",
        "foo3": "space example"
    },
    "data": "",
    "files": {},
    "form": {
        "key1": "value1"
    },
    "headers": {
        "x-forwarded-proto": "http",
        "x-forwarded-port": "80",
        "host": "postman-echo.com",
        "x-amzn-trace-id": "Root=1-61079427-695779ad39ea36724d06bc33",
        "content-length": "11",

        "content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        "user-agent": "PostmanRuntime/7.28.2",
        "accept": "*/*",
        "cache-control": "no-cache",
        "postman-token": "e4d652b8-65c9-49ee-bf34-bc41793be633",
        "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",

    },
    "json": {
        "key1": "value1"
    },
    "url": "http://postman-echo.com/post?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2&foo3=space%20example"
}

--> The response shows the following application/x-www-form-urlencoded:

    "form": {
        "key1": "value1"
    },



Note:
- Only the active form of the body will be sent.
  So raw or form-data or urlencoded.

Ch. 106. Automate Form URL Encoded Request Payload.

Quiz 16: Quiz

Question 1:
The format used by x-www-form-urlencoded and the query parameter to define key value pair is exactly the same.
- True

Question 2:
In case of x-www-form-urlencoded, the url is percent encoded
- True

Question 3:
When using formParam() method, we need to explicitly send the content type as application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- Not required.
  - What is necessary is that you have to tell RestAssured not to use the default characterset (charset=ISO-8859-1).
    That can be done in multiple ways. One of them is to use:

        requestSpecBuilder
                .setBaseUri(baseURI)
                .setContentType("application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8")
                .log(LogDetail.ALL);
        requestSpecification = requestSpecBuilder.build();

Ch. 108. Automate JSON Schema Validation.

Resources:
- https://jsonschema.net/home
- https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#json-schema-validation
- you can validate that a resource (/products) conforms with the schema:

  get("/products").then().assertThat().body(matchesJsonSchemaInClasspath("products-schema.json"));

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.rest-assured/json-schema-validator -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
    <artifactId>json-schema-validator</artifactId>

import static io.restassured.module.jsv.JsonSchemaValidator;


Test:
    @Test
    public void testJsonSchema() {
        given()
                .log().all()
                .when()
                .get()
                .then()
                .log().all()
                .assertThat()
                .statusCode(HTTP_Status_code_OK)
        ;
    }

Question 1:
For JSON Schema validation, the JSON file should be in the class path
- True
  - You mean: the json file containng the schema.

Question 2:
matchesJsonSchemaInClasspath() method belongs to REST Assured and no external dependency is required
- False.

Question 3:
The Required property in the JSON Schema indicates that the JSON field is mandatory
- True.

Section 23: Rest Assured - Filters

Ch. 110. Log Request and Response Specification to the Console.

Resources:
- https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#filters
- https://javadoc.io/static/io.rest-assured/rest-assured/4.4.0/index.html?io/restassured/RestAssured.html

A filter allows you to inspect and alter a request before it's actually committed and also inspect and alter the response before it's returned to the expectations. 
You can regard it as an "around advice" in AOP terms. 
Filters can be used to implement custom authentication schemes, session management, logging etc. 
To create a filter you need to implement the io.restassured.filter.Filter interface. To use a filter you can do:

given().filter(new MyFilter()). ..

There are a couple of filters provided by REST Assured that are ready to use:

 1. io.restassured.filter.log.RequestLoggingFilter: A filter that'll print the request specification details.
 2. io.restassured.filter.log.ResponseLoggingFilter: A filter that'll print the response details if the response matches a given status code.
 3. io.restassured.filter.log.ErrorLoggingFilter: A filter that'll print the response body if an error occurred (status code is between 400 and 500).

Section 24: Serialization and De-serialization.

Ch. 113. Serializaation and De-serialization in Java.


Serialization:

Java Object --> Byte Stream --> persisted in a file, db or memory

De-serialization:

Persisted data --> Byte Stream --> Java Object.


Ch. 114. Serialization and De-serialization in Rest Assured.


POJO / Map / List Java Object --> Object Mapping (Serialize) --> JSON / XML Object --> HTTP Request  --> Server
                                      <-- Deserialize        <--                   <-- HTTP Response <--

                                 Jackson / Gson : JSON Object
                                 JAXB           : XML Object 
                                      Serializers

Ch. 115. Object Mapping Support.

Resources:
- https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#object-mapping

Note:
A JSON object can be created from a HashMap but also from a List (not mentioned in the article).


Ch. 116. Serialize Map to JSON using Jackson.

pom.xml:

        <!--- Jackson-databind is necessary in case an object is sent as body as value of a Map
         See Part09TestRequestPayloadMultipleWays; public void testValidatePostRequestPayloadAsMap() -->
        <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
            <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
            <version>2.12.4</version>
        </dependency>

--> Supports the use of Jackson for (de)serialization.

Used e.g. in $HOME/Development/workspaceStudy/RestAssured/src/test/java/com/rest/Part091TestRequestPayloadMultipleWays.java

--> New version 


Ch. 117. Serialize List to JSON Array using Jackson.


Ch. 118. Serialize Jackson Object Node to JSON Object.

Now a Jackson object will be created directly instead of translating a HashMap or List.

JSON Object:

ObjectMapper
  createObjectNode()  --> returns an instance of the class ObjectNode.


Ch. 119.Serialize Jackson Array Node to JSON Array.

ObjectMapper
  createArrayNode() --> returns an instance of the class ArrayNode.

Ch. 120. What is POJO?

Ch. 121. simple POJO: Create Mock Request.

Creation of Mock Request postSimplePojo in Postman.

Ch. 122. Simple POJO: Serialization.

Ch. 123. Simple POJO: De-serialization.

Ch. 124. Workspace POJO: Serialize and De-serialize.

Create a PoJo for the nested JSON.

Body:
{
    "workspace": {
        "name": "MyFifthWorkspace",
        "type": "personal",
        "description": "workspace for BDD Style testing the POST HTTP method"
    }
}
--> Corresponding PoJo.

The following classes have been created:

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Workspace {
    private String name;
    private String type;
    private String description;
}

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class WorkspaceRoot {
    private Workspace workspace;
}

Ch. 125. Workspace POJO: Paramterize Tests using TestNG Data Provider.

Question 1:
Serialization in REST Assured is the process of converting JSON to Java Object
- False (the other way around)

Question 2:
Which library is used for serialization and de-serialization of JSON
- jackson-databind


Question 3:
For content type "application/json", in which order REST Assured looks for library in the class path in order to do serialization and de-serialization?
- Jackson first and then Gson
  See below for explanation.

https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#content-type-based-serialization
JSON using Jackson 2 (Faster Jackson (databind))
JSON using Jackson (databind)
JSON using Gson
JSON using Johnzon
JSON-B using Eclipse Yasson
XML using JAXB


Question 4:
If content type is specified as "application/xml", which of the below library will REST Assured use for serialization and de-serialization
- JAXB

Question 5:
Is it possible to set an explicit serializer instead of having REST Assured search for a suitable library in the class path?
- Yes

Question 6:
REST Assured supports custom content type serialization
- True


Question 7:
ObjectMapper class from Jackson can be used for serialization outside REST Assured
- True

Question 8:
Jackson Object Node can be used to represent a JSON Array
- False

Question 9:
REST Assured's body() method can accept Jackson's Object Node as an argument
- True

Question 10:
A POJO class is type safe
- True

Question 11:
Which of the below is the advantage of using a POJO class
- Both (Readability, Reusability)


Assignment 2: Assignment - Create POJO and serialize this JSON.

Use below freely available public POST API to create a user. 
This is mocked, so it will not create any user in reality, but it will send a successful response with HTTP Status code 201.

This is what you need to do as part of this assignment:

1. Execute the API in the POSTMAN first to make sure it's working as expected
  - Done.

2. Create a POJO for the request body
  - Done.

3. Serialize using REST Assured
  - Done.

4. You can validate the response http status code and the response body. 
  For the body, just validate that the content type is JSON and the presence of the ID field. Value doesn't matter. 
  Just that it should have a non null value.

URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Method: POST

Body:

{
  "name": "Leanne Graham",
  "username": "Bret",
  "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
  "address": {
    "street": "Kulas Light",
    "suite": "Apt. 556",
    "city": "Gwenborough",
    "zipcode": "92998-3874",
    "geo": {
      "lat": "-37.3159",
      "lng": "81.1496"
    }
  }
}
HTTP Status code: 201

Response body:

{
    "id": 11
}


Questions for this assignment
How many POJO classes are required to represent this JSON?


===================================================================================================
2021-08-07:

Setup:

- Postman:
  - Postman Essentionals Collection/pstJsonPlaceHolderTypicodeComUsers
    - POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
      - Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

Response:
{
    "name": "Leanne Graham",
    "username": "Bret",
    "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
    "address": {
        "street": "Kulas Light",
        "suite": "Apt. 556",
        "city": "Gwenborough",
        "zipcode": "92998-3874",
        "geo": {
            "lat": "-37.3159",
            "lng": "81.1496"
        }
    },
    "id": 11
}

So yes: there Response body contains:
{
  ..
  "id": 11
}

Section 25: Jackson Annotations.

Ch. 126. Not Null.


In class Workspace the variable 'id' will initially be null.
In order not to show this variable when the serialized JSON is sent the following is used:

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude;
- @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)


See below (and in class RestAssured/src/main/java/com/rest/entities/Workspace.java):

@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
public class Workspace {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String type;
    private String description;

    public Workspace(String name, String type, String description) {
        this.name = name;
        this.type = type;
        this.description = description;
    }
}


Ch. 127. Non Default.

@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT)

In this case:

@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT)
public class Workspace {
    // Example for showing a field that should not be used for serialization at all.
    private int i;

    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String type;
    private String description;

    public Workspace(String name, String type, String description) {
        this.name = name;
        this.type = type;
        this.description = description;
    }
}

--> Now in the logging the variables i and id will not be shown:
    Because both now have default values.

The annotation @JsonInclude can be used at class- and at variable-level.


Ch. 128. Non Empty.

    // Example of the use of a variable that should not be empty.
    @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY)

This means that the variable will only be added to the JSON if it is not empty.
It should not be null; it includes NON_NULL as well.


Ch. 129. JSON Ignore and JSON Ignore Poperties.

An alternative for @JsonInclude() is @JsonIgnore.
It can be used on a variable but also on a set-method.

@JsonIgnore can not be used if a variable will be filled during deserialization.
In that case @JsonIgnoreProperties should be used.

Section 26: Complex POJO - Live Practice

Instead of 

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ArrayNode;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode;

We will now set up classes for a more intricate JSON.


Ch. 130. API Walkthrough

Create a complex JSON and use it for serialization / deserialization.


POST https://api.getpostman.com/collections
- Use Postman Essentials Environment.



https://api.gepostman.com/collections

The complext json that is being used is available on:
- https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/intro-api/
  - On the 2nd line click on 'Postman API'
    - Scroll down to find the complex JSON example:

{
  "collection": {
    "info": {
      "name": "Sample Collection",
      "description": "This is just a sample collection.",
      "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
    },
    "item": [
      {
        "name": "This is a folder",
        "item": [
          {
            "name": "Sample POST Request",
            "request": {
              "url": "https://postman-echo.com/post",
              "method": "POST",
              "header": [
                {
                  "key": "Content-Type",
                  "value": "application/json"
                }
              ],
              "body": {
                "mode": "raw",
                "raw": "{\"data\": \"123\"}"
              },
              "description": "This is a sample POST Request"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Sample GET Request",
        "request": {
          "url": "https://postman-echo/get",
          "method": "GET",
          "description": "This is a sample GET Request"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

Place the JSON in https://jsonpathfinder.com/

Create in Postman:
- https://warped-star-612427.postman.co/workspace/Postman-Essentials-Workspace~7fcf506e-2dfa-4530-ba94-78a0a315a86b/request/2814220-d7134633-144c-4801-b8c4-bfa6deed5008
  - Name: CreateCollection
- Response:

{
    "collection": {
        "id": "b02d977f-bd34-4a42-a192-94ccc520270c",
        "name": "Sample Collection",
        "uid": "2814220-b02d977f-bd34-4a42-a192-94ccc520270c"
    }
}

I do not see a new Collection in Postman. Just the successful response.

Ch. 131. Create POJO's.

Based on the JSON described above a suitable set of classes needs to be set up in com.rest.entities.


Ch. 132. Build Payload and Serialize.
